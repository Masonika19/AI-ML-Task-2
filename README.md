# AI-ML-Task-2
# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#Aim
To understand the dataset by generating summary statistics and visualizations using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Tools I used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

# Steps Performed
1. I used the dataset Iris .csv
2. Displayed basic information`
3. Visualized:
   - Histograms for each numerical feature
   - Boxplots to detect outliers
   - Correlation matrix using heatmap
   - Pairplots to explore feature relationships
   - Interactive scatter plot using Plotly

#  Key Insights
- Some features are strongly correlated (e.g., Petal Length vs Petal Width)
- No missing values in the dataset
- Iris species are linearly separable in certain feature pairs
